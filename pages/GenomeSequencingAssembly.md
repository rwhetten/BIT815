## BIT815: Deep Sequencing Data Analysis

### Genome Sequencing and Assembly

### Global Overview

De-novo assembly of a complete and accurate genome sequence from high-throughput sequencing data is a challenging computational problem for any genome that contains repeated DNA sequences longer than the typical sequencing read length ([Simpson & Pop, 2015](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-genom-090314-050032)). The single-copy regions between repeated sequences can be assembled into contiguous stretches of sequences, or "contigs". Construction and sequencing of "mate-paired" sequencing libraries allow retrieval of DNA sequences known to occur at a specific spacing in the genome, which can range from 2 kb to 35 or 40 kb. These data allow linking of contigs into larger "scaffolds" that contain gaps where the exact sequence is unknown but the approximate size is known. "Draft" genome assemblies often consist of many such scaffolds, and the unknown sequences in the gaps within scaffolds can represent half or more of the total length of the scaffolds. The process of "finishing" a genome sequence involves collecting sequence data to fill the gaps in scaffolds and ensure that all contigs are placed in the correct order and orientation relative to each other to form a complete continuous sequence of each chromosome of the genome of interest. This process is difficult and expensive, so few eukaryotic genomes larger than those of fungi are completely finished. Long-read sequencing methods, such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies single-molecule sequencing, provide reads long enough to bridge across many repetitive regions in eukaryotic genomes, and such long-read data have been used to improve existing assemblies of mammalian genomes (e.g. the gorilla genome, [Gordon et al, 2016](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6281/aae0344.long)) and carry out de-novo assembly of fungal genomes (e.g. the genome of *Verticillium dahliae* [Faino et al, 2015](http://mbio.asm.org/content/6/4/e00936-15.long)).
Alternative approaches to scaffolding have been developed, based on the observation that DNA packaged into nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin shows a consistent pattern of long-range interactions both *in vivo* using nuclei isolated from living cells ([Lieberman-Aiden et al, Science 326:289-293](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2858594/), 2009) or *in vitro* using DNA-histone complexes prepared from purified DNA and proteins ([Putnam et al, Genome Research 26:342-350](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772016/), 2016). In the past few years, methods to use these long-range interactions to aid in scaffolding genome assemblies and determining the linkage phase of genetic variants in diploid genomes have been developed ([Burton et al, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4117202/), [Kaplan & Dekker, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880131/), and [Selvaraj et al, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180835/), along with [Putnam et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772016). Another means of detecting long-range linkages among DNA sequences is based on a microfluidic technology that allows labeling of DNA sequence reads from long (50 kb to 150 kb) DNA molecules with the same 14-base barcode sequence, so that reads can be grouped into clusters of known relationships ([Mostovoy et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927370/).


### Objective

The objective of this section is to introduce participants to important issues to consider in genome sequencing and assembly experiments. Simulation of sequencing reads from a bacterial genome will provide example datasets that will serve as input to an assembly program, and will allow testing the effect of sequencing error rate on assembly quality. 

### Description

De-novo assembly of short DNA sequence reads into a complete genome reference sequence is a challenging and computationally-intensive task for genomes larger than a few megabases, and can be difficult even for small bacterial genomes that happen to be rich in repeated DNA sequences. The key challenge in assembly is to correctly place DNA segments that occur only once in the genome relative to repeated sequences that occur multiple times.  The Overlap-Layout-Consensus strategy used to assemble the human genome sequence from Sanger sequencing reads  (500 to 900 nt in length) is not feasible for assembly from short reads (50 to 150 nt in length). An alternative approach, based on de Bruijn  graph theory, breaks reads up into short fragments called *k-mers*, which are oligomers *k* nt in length, with lengths typically ranging from 19 to 75 depending on read length. These k-mers can be much more quickly indexed and analyzed than longer reads, and very efficient mathematical methods are available for solving the problem of ordering k-mers into contiguous sequences (Pevzner et al, 2001). A recent publication described a hybrid approach, in which short paired-end reads are analyzed as k-mers, then extended into "super reads" by searching for unique overlapping k-mer sequences at the ends of each read. This process converts large numbers of short reads into a much smaller number of longer "super reads" that can be assembled using the OLC strategy ([Zimin et al, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799473/)). A recent publication by [Zimin et al (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5411773/) extends the "super-read" concept to allow incorporation of long single-molecule sequence reads from Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms to form "mega-reads", and describes assembly of the *Aegilops tauschii* genome to a higher degree of contiguity than previously reported.

### Key Facts

The length and number of repetitive sequences in a particular genome determine the sequencing strategy to produce data likely to allow a relatively complete assembly. The objective is to have good coverage of the genome with pairs of reads that are far enough apart to guarantee that both reads of a pair are **not** within the same repetitive sequence element.  If one read is within a repetitive element and the other read is in flanking sequence that is unique in the genome, then that read pair provides evidence locating one copy of the repetitive element within a specific unique-sequence region in the genome. Different genomes have differing lengths and arrangements of repetitive DNA sequences in the genome, so different strategies may be required for library construction and sequencing.

Different approaches have been proposed to evaluate the quality and completeness of *de novo* genome assemblies. [Assemblathon-1 (2011)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2011/09/16/gr.126599.111.abstract) and [Assemblathon-2 (2013)](https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2047-217X-2-10) were multi-investigator projects to compare the utility of different software tools and analytical approaches to genome assembly. [QUAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624806/) and [REAPR](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r47) are software tools for assessment of the quality of genome assemblies, both published in 2013. QUAST offers many metrics of assembly quality based on similarity to an existing reference genome assembly, and some metrics than can be applied to new genome assemblies that lack any existing reference sequence. REAPR assesses the degree of correctness of an assembly based on results of re-mapping of paired-end reads back to the assembly and finding regions that don't match the expected distribution of paired-end sequences - see the [manual](../assets/reapr_manual.pdf) for details. REAPR is installed on the VCL image, so it is available for use on instances running on the VCL. [BUSCO](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/19/3210/211866/BUSCO-assessing-genome-assembly-and-annotation), described in a 2015 publication, assesses assembly completeness by testing for the presence of conserved genes found in many existing genome assemblies of species from the relevant phylogenetic realm to the assembly being tested. The authors of the BUSCO publication maintain a [website](http://busco.ezlab.org/) where data for evaluation of genome assemblies from various taxa of organisms can be downloaded.


The kinds of libraries and sequencing data required for genome assembly has changed over time, as assembly software algorithms have changed and new library construction and sequencing technology has developed.
- [Gnerre et al. (2011)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029755/) recommended the following library types and sequencing nucleotide coverage  for assembly of mammalian genomes with the ALLPATHS-LG assembler: 45x coverage of a library with 180-bp inserts using 2x100-nt paired end reads, plus 45x coverage of a mate-pair library with 3-kb inserts using 2x100-nt paired end reads, and ideally 1x to 5x coverage of mate-pair libraries with 6 kb or longer inserts. See the [Illlumina webpage](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/mate-pair-sequencing.html) for more information on mate-pair libraries. 
- [Love et al (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4779211/) reported that sequencing data from a single library of 450-bp inserts prepared without the use of PCR and sequenced with paired-end 250-nt reads could be assembled by the DISCOVAR *de novo* assembler, at a much lower cost for library preparation and sequencing than the multi-library approach recommended by Gnerre et al. The resulting assembly had somewhat lower contiguity (measured by scaffold or contig N50) and completeness (measured by the presence of conserved orthologous genes using BUSCO) than the previous assembly produced by assembly of sequencing data from multiple libraries using ALLPATHS-LG.
- [Dudchenko et al (2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5635820/) reported assembly of human and mosquito genomes from a variety of library types (including the paired-end 250-nt sequences of 450-bp inserts recommended for DISCOVAR *de novo* assembly) into chromosome-scale scaffolds, by supplementing the whole-genome sequencing coverage with Hi-C long-distance chromosome contact data.
- [Jain et al (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060) reported assembly of a human genome from single-molecule sequences obtained from an Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION sequencer, or from the long-read data combined with Illumina short-read sequence data, with impressive results in terms of contiguity and the ability to phase genetic variants into the two haplotypes expected of a heterozygous diploid organism.

#### Variant discovery and genotyping by sequencing
- SNPs vs structural variants: SNPs are more abundant as sites, but insertion/deletion (indel) and rearrangement events can affect more nucleotides genome-wide
-  Common alleles vs rare: common alleles are easier to detect and effects can be estimated accurately; rare alleles can be so hard to find that specific strategies are needed to identify sufficient numbers of individuals to provide statistical power to estimate SNP effects
- Barcoding works well for genotyping specific individuals at SNPs with common alleles: pooled samples work well for identifying rare variants and estimating allele frequencies. 

### Exercise - assembly of a bacterial genome from simulated Illumina 100-nt PE reads
-  Simulation of paired-end short reads from a bacterial genome sequence can be done with the GemReads.py program used previously, but that process takes some time.  Two files containing simulated 100-nt paired-end reads from the *Lactobacillus helveticus* strain DPC4571 genome (sim.r1.fq.gz and sim.r2.fq.gz) are in the /data/DPC4571/ directory of the VCL machine image.
-  Use the `df` (remember "disk free") command to see how much free space is left on your VCL instance - this is a useful practice before doing anything that generates large output files, because it is frustrating to start a large computing job and have it fail due to a lack of disk space to store output files.
-  Map the simulated reads back to the reference genome sequence using the BWA aligner - execute the commands `bwa index` and `bwa mem` at a terminal prompt for an overview of the command-line options of the commands to create an index of the reference genome sequence and align the simulated reads to it, or read the [manual](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) to learn more of the details about how to carry out alignment of short reads to a reference genome. NOTE: BWA programs read from gzipped files, so you do not need to gunzip the reference genome (DPC4571.fasta.gz) sequence file in the data folder, or the sim.r1 and sim.r2 sequence read files. By default, BWA writes SAM-format output to STDOUT (the screen), so you need to redirect that to a file or another command in order to save it. In order to save space, it is most efficient to pipe the SAM output first to `samtools view` to convert it to BAM format, then to `samtools sort` to sort the BAM file so it is ready for use in other downstream applications. The BWA and samtools packages are installed in the search path, so you can use these programs without specifying a complete path to the executable files.
- The MaSuRCA assembler package is already compiled and installed in the /usr/local/masurca directory of the VCL machine image. Use the MaSuRCA assembler to assemble the simulated reads into a genome assembly, following the instructions given in the MaSuRCA [Quick Start Guide](../assets/MaSuRCA_QuickStartGuide.pdf). The average insert size and standard deviation of insert sizes of the simulated paired-end reads is available from the information scrolled to the screen by the BWA mem program during the alignment process, or in the [KmerCounting\_ErrorCorrection.sh](../assets/K-merCounting_ErrorCorrection.sh) script in the section that describes the GemReads.py command used to simulate the reads.
- Comparison of the genome assembly to the genome reference sequence is possible using whole-genome alignment with [MUMmer v.3](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/). This package of programs is installed in the /usr/local/MUMmer3.23/ directory; look at the list of programs and type `nucmer -h` at a terminal prompt to see the options available for the nucmer sequence alignment program.
